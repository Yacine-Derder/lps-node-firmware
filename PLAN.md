# MUL development roadmap

## Objective

Infrastructure-free relative localization for teams of mobile robots using
downlink UWB TDoA, mobile anchor-like robots (ALRs), receiver/localizing robots
(RLRs), relative clock synchronization, and occasional TWR measurements for
online error calibration.

This is the single overview of current development state.
See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for operating rules and
[the architecture](docs/mul_architecture.md) for durable technical decisions.
Source code remains authoritative for what is actually implemented.

## Status meanings

- **Not started:** planned work without a completed implementation.
- **Implemented/software tested:** relevant builds and automated tests pass;
  physical acceptance is still outstanding.
- **Hardware validated:** physical measurements support the milestone's criteria;
  identify whether validation was performed by the user or by the implementing agent.
- Completing implementation alone must not promote a milestone to hardware validated.

## Completed baseline

| Milestone | Current status | Established capability |
|---|---|---|
| Stage 0 — Custom MUL operating modes | Complete | Modes 5/6, USB selection, EEPROM persistence |
| Stage 1 — ALR-to-RLR UWB communication | Complete | Periodic broadcast, passive reception, source/sequence diagnostics |
| Stage 2 — Hardware-delayed TX and accurate TX/RX timestamps | Hardware validated (user-reported) | Embedded antenna-referenced TX time and local raw RX time |
| Stage 3A.1 — Multi-ALR protocol and reference acquisition | Hardware validated (user-reported) | Reference reception, loss/reacquisition, and observed wraparound |
| Stage 3A.2 — Hardware-timed TDMA | Hardware validated (user-reported) | Both ALRs TX, passive RLR RX, approximately 500.04 ms separation, TX timestamp equality |
| Stage 3B.1 — Relative clock skew | Hardware validated (user-reported) | Stable negative skew, loss reset/reconvergence, preserved TX equality and RLR reception |
| Stage 3B.2a — Arrival-aligned affine mapping | Hardware validated (user-reported) | Mapping-state behavior and loss/restart recovery; conversion accuracy not independently measured |

Stages 0–2, 3A.1, 3A.2, 3B.1, and 3B.2a are implemented and software tested.
Hardware-validation status follows the user's current physical-test reports;
it is not a claim of hardware testing by Codex for this milestone.
The prior timestamp-discrepancy investigation does not establish a root cause;
retain that distinction when interpreting validation and diagnostics.

## Current milestone — Stage 3B.2b.1: External propagation-delay correction

Status: **Implemented/software tested.**
Objective: accept independently supplied reference-to-follower one-way delay and
provide separate simultaneous-clock forward/inverse conversions with explicit
link, units, age, epoch, and uncertainty checks. No live measurement source exists;
correction remains unavailable in normal firmware, with MAP still UNCALIBRATED.

Current configuration, all using Bitcraze DW1000 LPS nodes:

| Node | Address | Current role |
|---|---|---|
| ALR 1 | `0x84` | Reference transmitter, approximately 1 Hz |
| ALR 2 | `0x85` | Reference-following transmitter, approximately 500 ms later |
| RLR | `0x86` | Passive receiver of both sources |

Software acceptance covers synthetic 0/1/5/10/30 m delays with signed skew,
forward/inverse ground truth, wrong estimates, wraparound, precision, link/units,
age/epoch rejection, resets, missing packets, re-anchoring, uncertainty propagation,
and long runs. Existing skew, arrival mapping, TDMA, RLR, and TX tests still pass.

Stage 3B.2a's supplied physical results validate WARMUP/VALID and loss/restart
state behavior with stable skew and preserved TX/RLR operation, not independent
conversion accuracy. The interruption and USB disconnect were intentional.
No new correction-accuracy hardware checkpoint is meaningful without delay input;
an optional three-node regression smoke test may check unchanged live behavior.
Live delay acquisition will need its own physical validation. Stop here and wait
for instructions before Stage 3B.2b.2.

## Pending milestones

### Stage 3B.2b.2 — Live TWR-based delay acquisition

Status: **Not started.** Objective: acquire independent one-way delay information
from validated TWR exchanges for the existing correction interface.
Acceptance: clock-domain conversion, direction, age, epoch and uncertainty are
justified; hardware checks quantify ranging/correction accuracy and radio effects.
This supplies measurements; Stage 4's online error calibration remains separate.

### Stage 3C — TDoA-ready multi-ALR observation pipeline

Status: **Not started.** Objective: associate observations by source and transmission,
retaining clock domain, correction model, validity, and uncertainty.
Acceptance: tests reject missing/stale/inconsistent associations; hardware
observations from multiple ALRs can be paired without mixing clock domains.

### Stage 4 — Occasional TWR and online measurement-error calibration

Status: **Not started.** Objective: obtain occasional TWR measurements to calibrate
an online error model without replacing the downlink observation flow.
Acceptance: exchange and failure tests pass; physical calibration measurements
support the model and quantify their effect on broadcast operation.

### Stage 5 — Downlink TDoA localization with uncertain mobile ALR poses

Status: **Not started.** Objective: estimate relative RLR position while accounting
for ALR motion, uncertain poses, and timing/measurement uncertainty.
Acceptance: simulated geometry/motion tests expose observability limits; physical
relative-position estimates are compared against an independent reference.

### Stage 6 — Probabilistic localization and experimental evaluation

Status: **Not started.** Objective: integrate probabilistic measurement conditions,
pose uncertainty, and LOS information into localization and evaluate performance.
Acceptance: controlled software evaluations and repeatable robot experiments
compare accuracy, uncertainty consistency, robustness, and relevant baselines.

Update milestone status in place as evidence changes; Git preserves earlier states.
